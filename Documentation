# Data Analysis Project Documentation

## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of basic data analysis techniques in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It focuses on exploring and visualizing a dataset of drinks by country, utilizing popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook file, which serves as the primary codebase for performing data analysis tasks. The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
- matplotlib.pyplot (for creating data visualizations)
- seaborn (for enhanced data visualization)

## Usage

To use this project and reproduce the data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) if they are not already installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named `your_notebook_name.ipynb` (replace with your actual notebook name) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

5. Run the code cells within the notebook one by one to execute the data analysis steps.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Data Loading

The project begins by loading the dataset from a CSV file using the `pd.read_csv()` function provided by the pandas library. The dataset, which contains information about drinks by country, is retrieved from a public URL.

### 2. Basic DataFrame Information

This section displays basic information about the DataFrame, including data types and missing values, using the `info()` method of pandas DataFrames.

### 3. Summary Statistics

Summary statistics for numerical columns in the dataset are calculated and displayed using the `describe()` method, providing insights into the distribution of data.

### 4. Data Exploration

The first few rows of the DataFrame are displayed using the `head()` method, offering an initial overview of the dataset's structure and content.

### 5. Visualization - Beer Servings by Continent

A boxplot is created to visualize the distribution of beer servings by continent. The `boxplot()` function from the Seaborn library is used for this purpose.

### 6. Visualization - Correlation Matrix

Two correlation matrices are visualized using heatmaps. The first heatmap displays the correlation between different numerical columns in the dataset, while the second one is a duplicate. The `heatmap()` function from Seaborn is employed for these visualizations.
