## Code Overview
This notebook performs the following tasks:

***Data Loading:*** It loads the dataset from the provided URL into a pandas DataFrame.

***Basic DataFrame Information:*** It displays basic information about the DataFrame, including the data types and missing values.

***Summary Statistics:*** It shows summary statistics for numerical columns, providing insights into the distribution of data.

***Data Exploration:*** It displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to give you an overview of the dataset.

***Data Filtering:*** It filters the data for Asian countries and randomly selects 5 countries from Asia for further 
                      analysis.

***Visualization -*** Beer Servings by Continent: It visualizes the distribution of beer servings by continent using a boxplot.

***Visualization -*** Correlation Matrix: It visualizes the correlation between different numerical columns using a heatmap.
